 &: bitwise AND- The bitwise AND operator (&) compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of
 the second operand. If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result
 bit is set to 0.
 ^ is the bitwise XOR operator that compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its second
 operand. If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding
 result bit is set to 0.
